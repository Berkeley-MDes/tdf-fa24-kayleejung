# Week 1: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

My focus of the week was to get reacquainted with CAD tools, and familiarize myself with Rhino which I have not used before. I followed a couple youtube tutorials outlining the Rhino interface, and practiced using the tools to model a watering can (not pictured because the app crashed before I saved - a good learning opportunity for future use). In my undergrad degree in engineering, I've used tools like Solidworks and Fusion360 for various academic and personal projects. My prior experience in CAD definitely helped in getting started with Rhino, since I am familiar with terms like 'extrude, sweep, revolve' etc, as well as visualizing how to model shapes from 2D sketches to 3D. However, there are noticeable differences in functionality/capability when comparing Rhino to more engineering-focused softwares. 

Differences I've noticed so far:
1. Solidworks is dimension-driven, and I heavily rely on the Smart Dimension tool when modeling. In Rhino, there is no tool to resize shapes after drawing. 
2. Rhino utilizes freeform surface modeling with NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational Basis Splines) Mathematical Model whereas Solidworks utilizes parametric modeling.
3. The freeform nature of Rhino is ideal for modeling organic shapes and curves. Solidworks is less compliant due to strict geometries. 

This week, I also got to try out the laser cutters at the Jacobs Makerspace! I have a 3D printer at home, but I've never been able to use a laser cutter before. I took a drawing I made of my dog, Cheeky, and redrew it in Adobe Illustrator. My initial cut with the laser cutter just etched the file instead of cutting through, but in my design I had specified an outer edge to be cut. The color and stroke of my lines were correct, but it appeared as black only on the laser cutting software. Through a bit of troubleshooting with file settings, particularly the way Adobe saves the file, I got a successful cut! The laser cutter is very efficient, as my keychain only took less than a minute to complete. I'm interested in ways I can incorporate this into future projects, both for MDes and art, especially with cutting acrylic sheets.

[Wooj Design](https://wooj.design/?srsltid=AfmBOorDeVysMCg3r3KpSV4qGdLmuIJUsZzFeqlC6aK6UUAvHGMSMRW9) is a design company based in Brooklyn, NY, that produces 3D-printed home goods, and notably lighting fixtures. The most popular design is the [Wavy Lamp](https://wooj.design/collections/shop/products/lamp), which is entirely 3D-printed, and designed using Rhino and Grasshopper. This was how I initially discovered Rhino and Grasshopper, though I never fully explored the software. As a bit of a math nerd, I am excited to utilize these new functions in future projects!
